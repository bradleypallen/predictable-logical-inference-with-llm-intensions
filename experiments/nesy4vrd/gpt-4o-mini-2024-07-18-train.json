This means that the subject of this property is specifically a `Person`, and it relates to things that are skateboard-related.\n\n2. **Understanding the Predicate**: \n   - The predicate `<rdfs:domain>` is used to specify the class of the subject that can be used with a particular property.

This class is equivalent to a union of classes that include `Horse`, `Person`, and `TrainEngine`, among others.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Relationship**: \n   - Since `<vrd:skateOn>` has a domain of `vrd:Person`, it means that the property is applicable to instances of `Person`. However, `<vrd:PullCapableThing>` includes `Person` but also includes other entities that are not relevant to the property `<vrd:skateOn>`.\n   - The domain of `<vrd:skateOn>` does not include `PullCapableThing` as a whole; it specifically includes `Person`.
